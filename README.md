This is my submission for Coursework 1.

The associated video which was attached with this submission details quite a bit of my codebase however there are a number of scripts in this submission which were not recorded due to the limited timeframe of the video; I hope they are relatively easy to understand.

The following are external scripts (i.e. I didn't make them):

- PlayerFlightControl.cs
- CustomPointer.cs
- CameraFlightFollow.cs

These scripts come from the 'Spaceflight Controls' free asset on the Unity Store: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/spaceflight-controls-24532

To the best of my knowledge, I did not use any other external code/scripts in my submission. 
I have included references wherever possible for Scripts that I got help/inspiration from Tutorials and explanations; I merely used these materials as a means of understanding the underlying problem, and did not copy their solutions. 

If you have any questions, please get in touch with me, my email is: ds86'at'hw(dot)ac(dot)uk

Thanks!
